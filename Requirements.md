# The problem
Self-employed people often have a template to work from when they create customer contracts. Copying and pasting what services should be included and adjusting the details of each service from their own template is time consuming, especially since it most times needs to be done manually.

# The need
A tool that allows service providers (e.g. self-employees and small businesses) to enter a contract text and then modify the necessary parts in a simple and smooth way with the goal to minimize manual labor and make the process of sending out contracts more efficient.

# Additional information

## Example of workflow
1. User enter the webpage.
2. (If it's the first time a user visits the page, the user adds all basic information; such as the static text of the contract as well as services that the user offers to clients.)
3. User fills out customer information
4. User tweaks the services (e.g., costs, amounts, etc.) and chooses all services that will be included in the contract.
5. (Extra, if possible: User checks the preview of the contract.)
6. User initiate generation of contract, which is downloaded as PDF.

## The structure of a contract
- A contract usually have some sections that stays the same no matter what service is provided, such as compay logo and contract section force mejor.
- A contract also have one or more sections that contain text that changes depending on the services provided, such as exchanges of the actual service, e.g., creating a logotype vs. creating an instagram post.
- In some sections of the contract it's crucial to list details about the customer. The invoice and contact info of the service priver always remains the same and only needs to be changed on rare occations. The invoice and contact info of the customer can be the same as in an other contract but can also changes frequently.
- The customer's information reoccurs in many different places in a contract and it's important that the information has integrity (is correct and consistent) throughout the contract.
- A contract always have signature lines and denotion of who is signing the contract.
